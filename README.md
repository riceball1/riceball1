# Hello World ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dana Ng

## About me

ðŸ”­ I'm currently diving deeper into the frontend and working on building out this [Frontend Dev Guide](https://riceball.gitbook.io/frontend-dev-guide/) as I interview for a frontend developer position. Additionally I'm building a [simple language cards app](https://github.com/riceball1/simple-language-cards-nextjs) using nextjs.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, SQL, Nodejs, Frontend Systems Design, DSA + Algorithims, and Data Visualization with D3.js
